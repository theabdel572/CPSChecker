This is an application created mainly for Minecraft PvP players in versions prior to 1.9. With this application you can forget about going to web pages all the time to see your clicks per second, since simply opening the application you can start. The application has a button of default size (which is small) so that people realize that they are clicking on that button, since all the clicks that are made outside that button will not be counted; I decided to do this way mainly because it is useless to make many clicks if you can not aim the player.
